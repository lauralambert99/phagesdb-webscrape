# phagesdb-webscrape
Webscrape performed on phagesdb.org to gather data for a machine learning project.  Used BeautifulSoup, and Chrome driver.

Code may not be the most pythonic out there, as it was my first venture using the language.  Any comments on how to improve will be welcomed.  If this helps in your own webscrape project, wonderful!
